# Project Deleted

This calendar automation project has been completely removed per user request.

The persistent authentication issues could not be resolved despite multiple attempts to:
- Rebuild OAuth system with fresh credentials
- Remove all access code barriers
- Replace React with static HTML
- Fix server-side redirects

The system was serving the correct backend APIs but frontend authentication logic continued to redirect to access pages across all devices and browsers, indicating a fundamental architectural issue that required starting fresh.
