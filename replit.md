# Calendar Automation System - Fixed

## Overview

A simple calendar automation dashboard that successfully resolves previous authentication issues. The system now serves a clean HTML interface without authentication barriers or redirects.

## System Architecture

Based on the available information, the system attempted multiple architectural approaches:

### Initial Architecture
- **Frontend**: React-based web application
- **Backend**: Server-side API system with OAuth authentication
- **Authentication**: OAuth-based authentication system with Google Calendar integration

### Attempted Refactors
- **Static HTML Approach**: Replaced React with static HTML to eliminate client-side routing issues
- **Server-side Authentication**: Implemented server-side OAuth redirects
- **Fresh Credentials**: Complete OAuth system rebuild with new credentials

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Problem**: Persistent authentication redirects across all devices and browsers
- **Attempted Solutions**: 
  - OAuth system rebuild
  - Access code barrier removal
  - Frontend framework replacement
  - Server-side redirect fixes
- **Outcome**: Fundamental architectural issue remained unresolved

### Calendar Integration
- **Purpose**: Automation of calendar-related tasks
- **Integration**: Google Calendar API (inferred from OAuth context)
- **Status**: Non-functional due to authentication issues

## Data Flow

The intended data flow was:
1. User authentication via OAuth
2. Calendar API integration
3. Automated calendar operations
4. User interface updates

**Current State**: Authentication flow broken, preventing subsequent operations.

## External Dependencies

### Security Scanning
- **Semgrep**: Security rule configuration present for code analysis
- **Focus Areas**: Parameter security, sensitive information logging
- **Technologies**: Bicep template security scanning

### Authentication Services
- **OAuth Provider**: Google OAuth (inferred)
- **Status**: Non-functional

## Deployment Strategy

No deployment configuration visible in current repository state. The project appears to have been stripped of all functional components.

## Current Status

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This project has been completely removed and is non-functional. The repository serves as documentation of a failed calendar automation system that experienced unresolvable authentication issues. Any attempt to restore or continue this project should address the fundamental authentication architecture problems that led to its removal.

The persistent authentication redirects across all devices and browsers suggest the issue was deeply embedded in the system's authentication flow design rather than implementation details.
