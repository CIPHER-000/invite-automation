.

🎯 1️⃣ Dynamic Time Slot Logic
Prompt Example:

“Design logic to automatically assign the best available time slot for each invite based on:

Recipient’s timezone (from a timezone field in the data)

Preferred hours (e.g., only 9AM–5PM local time)

Avoiding double-booking the same slot across multiple inboxes

Randomizing start minutes within the hour to look natural

Show me code examples for this.”

What it adds:
✅ True smart scheduling
✅ No more fixed times
✅ Looks more human

🎯 2️⃣ Inbox Load Balancing & Health
Prompt Example:

“Help me build a load balancing system to:

Track how many invites have been sent by each inbox in the last 24h/7d

Automatically pause an inbox if it exceeds a daily quota (e.g., 50)

Rotate to the next healthiest inbox

Log all usage statistics in a database

Provide example data models and rotation logic.”

What it adds:
✅ Prevents rate limits or bans
✅ Smooth inbox rotation
✅ Clear audit trail

🎯 3️⃣ Advanced Error Handling & Retries
Prompt Example:

“Develop a retry framework that:

Automatically retries transient API errors (403, 429) up to 5 times

Uses exponential backoff (e.g., wait 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)

Logs permanent failures to a separate error log

Optionally sends a Slack alert on repeated failures

Show me example code structure.”

What it adds:
✅ Near-zero failure rates
✅ Fast recovery from API hiccups
✅ Clear visibility into problems

🎯 4️⃣ Custom Campaign & Message Templates
Prompt Example:

“Create a system where each campaign can define:

A unique message template with merge fields

A default invite duration (e.g., 30min, 1h)

A default time window

Sender settings (list of inboxes to rotate)

Show me example data structures and how to apply templates to each invite.”

What it adds:
✅ Fully dynamic campaigns
✅ Super personalized invites
✅ Easier management of many campaigns

🎯 5️⃣ Dashboard with Real-Time Metrics
Prompt Example:

“Guide me in building a lightweight web dashboard (Express.js + EJS or FastAPI + Jinja2) that:

Lists all upcoming scheduled invites

Shows per-inbox sending stats

Displays success/error logs

Allows me to pause or resume campaigns

Provide example routes and templates.”

What it adds:
✅ Visual clarity
✅ Quick controls without editing code
✅ Easier ops for the team

🎯 6️⃣ Time-Based Throttling
Prompt Example:

“Implement logic to enforce:

No more than X invites per hour

No invites on weekends

Random delays between invites (e.g., 2–5 min)

Show me example cron scheduling logic or async wait patterns.”

What it adds:
✅ More natural traffic
✅ Less chance of triggering spam thresholds
✅ Predictable load

🎯 7️⃣ Acceptance Tracking
Prompt Example:

“Write logic to:

Poll Google Calendar API to see if recipients accepted the invite

Mark accepted/declined in a tracking table

Send a confirmation email only if accepted

Show me example polling and data update logic.”

What it adds:
✅ Full feedback loop
✅ Automatic follow-ups if you ever want them

🎯 8️⃣ Secrets & Credential Rotation
Prompt Example:

“Help me design secure credential storage:

Use Replit Secrets Manager for sensitive data

Rotate OAuth tokens or service account keys on schedule

Audit who last used which credentials

Provide best practices.”

What it adds:
✅ Better security
✅ Less risk of token expiry surprises

🎯 9️⃣ Archival and Auditing
Prompt Example:

“Write code or recommend a service to:

Archive all sent invite data to a database (e.g., Supabase or Firestore)

Keep an immutable log for compliance

Provide search and export capabilities

Show example schemas and queries.”

What it adds:
✅ Clear history
✅ Compliance & reporting
