Create a feature in the invite automation app that allows users to set a custom subject line for each campaign.

Requirements:
Campaign-Level Subject Line Configuration

When creating or editing a campaign, provide an input field where the user can define a custom subject line.

This subject line should be used in the calendar invite email that is sent out for all recipients in that campaign.

Personalization Support (Optional, Nice-to-Have)

Allow dynamic variables such as {{FirstName}}, {{CompanyName}}, etc., to be inserted into the subject line.

These variables should be replaced with actual contact data when the invite is sent.

Validation

Limit subject line length (e.g., max 100 characters).

Warn users if personalization variables are incorrectly formatted or missing from contact data.

Storage and Retrieval

Store the subject line in the campaign model/schema (e.g., campaign.subjectLine).

Ensure it is accessible during the calendar invite creation/sending process.

Fallback Handling

If no subject line is provided by the user, use a default subject line like:
"Meeting Invitation from {{SenderName}}"

Let me know if you'd like to extend this with A/B testing, multi-language support, or subject line recommendation AI.








You said:
Fallback is "Hi from {{SenderName}}" and personalization variables are  {{name}}, {{company}}, {{sender_name}}, {{email}}

Great—let’s tighten up that Replit prompt with your updated details:

Replit Prompt:

Create a feature in the invite automation app that allows users to set a custom subject line for each campaign.

Requirements:
Campaign-Level Subject Line Configuration

In the campaign creation/edit screen, provide an input field for a custom subject line.

This subject line will be applied to all invites sent in that campaign.

Personalization Variables

Support the following dynamic placeholders in the subject line:

{{name}} – recipient’s full name

{{company}} – recipient’s company name

{{sender_name}} – sender’s name

{{email}} – recipient’s email address

These variables must be replaced with the correct contact data when sending invites.

Fallback Handling

If the user does not set a custom subject line, default to:

Hi from {{sender_name}}

Validation

Maximum subject line length: 100 characters.

Validate that any variables used in the subject line are among the supported list.

If a variable is invalid or the corresponding contact field is missing, show an error message or skip personalization gracefully.

Storage & Retrieval

Store the subject line in the campaign model/schema (campaign.subjectLine).

Ensure it is retrieved and rendered properly at the time the invite email is generated.

Preview (Optional, Nice-to-Have)

Show a live preview of the subject line with sample data to help users understand how personalization will appear.
